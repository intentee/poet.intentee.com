Poet comes with an asset management system that is deeply integrated with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). That makes it easy to add and render different types of assets in your project. It also generates preload tags for imported resources.

You can read more about asset management in the [Managing assets](static-site-generator/references/managing-assets) article.
