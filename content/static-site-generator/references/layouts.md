Poet's design principle is that everything is either a shortcode or a markdown page. There are no other moving parts like templates or sections. This means that layouts are implemented as shortcodes and are located in the `/shortcodes` directory with other reusable pieces of content.

To learn more about shortcodes, check out the [Shortcodes](static-site-generator/references/shortcodes) article.
